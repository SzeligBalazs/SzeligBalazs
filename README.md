## ðŸ‘‹ Hello!
My name is BalÃ¡zs. I'm 14 years old.

I am coding for 4 years and I love it. I was starting my coding journey with Python. Then I was learning HTML and CSS and I created my first website. After I was learning C++ on an online course. In 2021 I decided to learn Flutter and Dart. Today I'm creating mobile applications with Flutter. Now I'm gonna learn Rust.
